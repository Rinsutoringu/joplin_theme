# Joplin_theme

[中文版文档](.README_Zh-CN.md)

A repo for a joplin style (focus to follow my typora theme)

if you do something changes, please use `update_files.bat` to update file from app config file path to repo path.



# How to Use

The Joplin theme should be placed in the `C:\Users\[UserAccountName]\.config\joplin-desktop` directory, and then restart Joplin to enable it.

The Typora theme should be placed in the `C:\Users\[UserAccountName]\AppData\Roaming\Typora\themes` directory, and then restart Typora to enable it.

There is already an automation script! Just double-click to execute it! If you want to uninstall the theme, simply overwrite the contents of the backup folder back to the Joplin root directory.

(To be automated)
